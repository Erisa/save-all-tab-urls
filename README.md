# Save All Tab URLs

[Download for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/save-all-tab-urls/) | [Download for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-all-tab-urls/bgjfbcjoaghcfdhnnnnaofkjbnelkkcm)

<hr>

This extension simply adds a button to the menu bar of your browser which opens a page containg a list of all the open tab URLs.

## Why?
Because I wanted it, and so I made it. The idea for this extension was born from when I needed to save all open URLs for further research. Can be used for collecting lists of sources among other things.

## Features
- Shows a list of open URLs.
- Export list to a file.

## Screenshots

## Downloads

- Only Firefox and Chrome are officially supported. Other Chromium-based browsers will likely work by association, but they won't be tested before a new version release.  
  - Firefox for Android will work and is supported, but not as extensively tested. Feel free to report any issues with the extension on Android.
  - Other Firefox-based browsers will only work if they support WebExtensions. This includes WaterFox, but not Pale Moon. These browsers are not tested or supported, if it works then it works.
- Browsers based on other engines (e.g. Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge Legacy) are not supported and will never be supported by me.
