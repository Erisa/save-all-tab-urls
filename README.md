# Save All Tab URLs

This extension simply adds a button to the menu bar of your browser which opens a page containg a list of all the open tab URLs.

## Why?
Because I wanted it, and so I made it. The idea for this extension was born from when I needed to save all open URLs for further research. Can be used for collecting lists of sources among other things.

## Features
- Shows a list of open URLs.

## Screenshots
